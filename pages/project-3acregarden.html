        <br><br>
        Our landscape changes with our memories, by what we remember and how we remember. This floor records the physical memory of each visit, changing it.
        <br><br>
        Lately being time-poor seems to be a common concern for people in contemporary society. As technology progresses in the guise of making our lives easier, are we speeding up, gaining time or are we engrossed, not noticing, as it slides away?
        <br><br>
        <i>“Photographs are a way of imprisoning reality… One can't possess reality, one can possess images, one can't possess the present but one can possess the past.” — Susan Sontag.</i>
        <br><br>
        Are we trying to subsume time by all the record taking we are doing? Is the proliferation of digital photographs, an attempt to hold onto all the moments that could easily slip away? When you take the photo, <i>“its duration become infinite” — Daniel Coffeen.</i>
        <br><br>
        But real world objects also hold memories, unlike digital photos they wear time differently on their surface, scratched, colours faded, dust. The detritus of the world lays present on their surface.
        <br><br>
        “Do roses grow everywhere in the world?” — Google search, answer inconclusive. Everyone must have seen a rose, in some form, right? Top results from Google search; Princess Diana: The Haunting Story of the English Rose, Our Rosé Wine Obsession, Explained: How Instagram Popularized..., Rose Book of Bible Charts, a Rose is a rose is a rose ... But not all roses are good. I think my algorithm is off. I’m using a vpn so I can watch videos of roses on Youtube — Not sure where in the world I am connected to.
        <br><br>
        Recently, I found an old VHS handycam recording of my Grandmother filmed around 10 years ago. In the footage she walks around her three acre garden, explaining the variety of different roses she has grown over many years.
        <br><br>
        She once taught me how to prune a rose bush, putting me to work in her garden. A role I cannot shake, as my mother gets me to prune the roses whenever I am at our family home. I don’t know if I’m doing it exactly how I was taught, or perhaps I have shifted the memory so that I am doing it the way I believe I was taught.
        <br><br>
        <i>“The first one I painted had three mountains. There are no mountains anywhere near my studio, and my Internet connection was down, so I had to paint from memory.” — Paul Chan.</i>
        <br><br>
        Memories are changing. How they are realized. How they are stored. No longer solely in the mind or our tomes of our grandmother’s bookcase, but openly on feeds and in data farms. Has the direction of our horizon blurred? Directionaly changed by how we review past events?
        <br><br>
        When our memories age, changed by time, do we treat them differently? Will we shift how we think of the future? We softly manipulate memory already, choosing carefully framing and selecting the photos we share to social media how we edit them, what memories we put into frames on the side table etc. Is it not only time until we are editing memories in our minds, say like in Total Recall (1990)? Or do we see them like the digital archive of the “so called world” aboard the Axiom ship that WALL-E travels to, accessing our large data farm.
        <br><br>
        In Three Acre Garden, Bayly considers how we experience time and biography as something we are constantly trying to control, holding on, review, as things slip away and become memories, to be ranked by others. Our landscape is shifting under our feet. Slipping between the past and the present; blending timelines with cuts like a florist preparing a bouquet.
        <br><br>
        “Memory is like sand in my hand” - Agnes Varda.
        <br><br>
        Documents hold memories for us, in the forms of photos letters and objects. We have memories that are based in events, times, or locations; like a 30th birthday, the place of our first kiss, that time we danced illegally in the alleyway where no one could see us, when we learnt how swim in the ocean. Some are only remembered because of a photo that was taken or a video someone kept. Maybe we don't remember learning ourselves, but we remember a time when we couldn’t. Maggie Nelson writes ".. the effect of an album of childhood photographs, in which each image replaces the memory it aimed to preserve", occurs when writing about it also.
        <br><br>
        There are two complementary strands to this exhibition. On one hand you have a recording from long time ago presented as a process of watching a memory, and on the other hand the making of a memory or a imprint onto an object that will hold that memory, like a kind of poetic databank.
